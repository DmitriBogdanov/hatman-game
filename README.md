# Hatman

A classic 2D metroidvania with trichromatic artstyle.  You, a player, is a wandering spirit exploring a dark limbo-like realm. Fight your way through the enemies, discover secrets scattered generously through every map, gather power and defeat the ultimate Big Baddie! The game is extremely lightweight and should have around a few hundred FPS on most machines.
