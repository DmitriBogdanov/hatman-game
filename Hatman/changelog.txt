# 20.01.05 - 20.04.10 #
	- Implemented classes 'Vector2' and 'Vector2d' in 'geometry_utils.h' header
	- Implemented class 'Rectangle' in 'geomentry_utils.h' header
	- Implemented basic 'Graphics' class using SDL2 and SDL2_images
	- Implemented 'consolelog' namespace containing functions for convenient debug printing
	- Implemented basic 'Game' class
	- Implemented class 'Input' for convenient polling and storage of events
	- Implemented 'globalconsts' namespace that stores hardcoded values
	- Implemented class 'Entity', capable of displaying static sprites and playing animations
	- Implemented class 'PhysicalEntity', containing basic physics logic
	- Implemented class 'Player' derived from 'PhysicalEntity'
	- Implemented class 'Level'. Levels are loaded from .TMX files, tilesets are
	embedded inside the map file. Map size is fixed and is identical to screen size
	due to static camera (or rather, a lack of camera)
	- Implemented header 'level_objects.h', containing classes corresponding to various
	objects (aka level exits, for now)

# 20.06.17 - 20.07.04 #
	- Changed map format from .TMX to .JSON, 'tinyxml' was abandoned in favor of
	'nlohmann_json' for parsing new format

	embedded in a map file. Tilisets are stored as .JSON, parsing happens inside the tileset class
	itself
	- Implemented 'Tileset' and 'Tile' classes, tile objects are now unique and independent objects,
	rather than being an id referring to a tileset object
	- Improved tile system: tiles now have an optional 'interaction' member, that handles unique
	tile interaction. All interactive tiles are unique classes derived from regular 'Tile',
	storage and logic is handled via the use of polymorphism
	- Implemented static (aka global) access to Graphics object through static pointer. Deduced further
	applications of this feature and implemented such access to a 'Game' object. Objects with such
	access are initialized before the creation of 'Game' object
	- Implemented 'TileStorage' class that stores loaded tilesets inside an object to prevent repetitive
	loading of the same tilesets while changing levels

# 20.07.05 #

	- Implemented custom map size (previously, size 20x12 was hardcoded)
	- A number of helper classes changed to be nested in main classes
	- 'Tag' functions were implemented ('tag' is any string that contains [prefix] and {suffix})

# 20.07.09 #
	- Small optimizations in 'Level' class
	- Implemented saving (but not loading)

# 20.07.10 #

	- Small changes to 'PhysicalEntity' flags
	- Implemented logic that allows GUI to draw elements as objects on a map (rather than overlay)
	- Improved tile interaction logic - added two-step trigger check: successfull first check puts tile into an 'activated'
	state, successfull second check triggers tile interaction

# 20.07.17 #
	- Minor functionality added to 'Vector2' class
	- Improved GUI text logic
	- GUI now supports numbers and symbols {,.!?-:}
	- Fixed bug that prevented 'Gui::make_text()' from displaying last word of the text

# 20.07.18 #
	- Implemented centered display of single-line text through new method 'make_line_centered()'

# 20.07.20 #
	- Started working on more advanced Entity system: from now on entities will be created and
	handled through 3 headers: 'entity_base.h', 'entity_type.h', 'entity_unique.h' that will
	contain generic methods. Class 'Entity' is drasticaly refactored, it now contains following
	classes: 'Entity::Visuals', 'Entity::Physics' - objects of these classes contains various
	generic methods and variables related to entity logic, 'Entity' objects store pointers
	to these helper clases - given part of logic is not present, 'Entity' holds nullptr
	- Marked all non-usable default constructors as '= delete' - apparently that's a thing

	- Implemented text color change
	- Implemented smooth text display (with fixed delays between each new symbol appearing)
	- Implemented emit queue to ensure make input lifetime independent from the moment when emit was added
	during a frame. Instant emits are now ensured to have excatly 1 full frame of lifetime.
	- Switched to C++17 standard

# 20.08.08 #
	- Implemented templated container type 'Collection<>'. 'Collection' is a polymorphic container
	with a sole ownership over its content. 'Collection' allows insertion of elements, which provides
	caller with a handle to inserted element that can be used to access or erase the element.
	'Collection' allows convenient iteration without exposing implementation through the use
	of custom iterators
	- Switched to the use of 'Collection<Object>' insted of 'std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Object>>'
	wherever necessary 
	- Added iterator 'erase' to 'Collection<>' to allow cleanup of 'dead' objects through iteration

	- Implemented algorithm for rounding values up to 32 (tile size)
	- Implemented hashing function for 'Vector2'
	- Revamped tile storage to use unordered_map (tile positions as keys) instead of collection,
	such design culls unnecessary calculations as it allows objects to iterate over only the adjastent
	tiles without checking distance to all tiles on the map. Drastic perfomance improvement for big
	levels and situations with a lot of entities in the same spot. Further optimizations down the line.
	- Minor fixes

# 21.02.04 #
	- Optimized tile updating and drawing to use new map system
	- Optimized range check for entity freezing mechanic

# 21.02.05 #

	- Separated tile layers into 2 categories: layers and backlayers, backlayer tiles are rendered without
	executing any of their logic behind regular tiles, which allows combination of regular tiles and
	'background' tiles for better visuals

# 21.07.05 #
	- Made sensible namespaces for player form consts, moved mass and friction const to form consts
	- Removed elapsed time from runLeft(), runRight() parameters as with new force system it became redundant
	- Implemented crude from change
	- Fixed a bug where enemies would not chase player if he's standing to the left of them

# 21.07.06 #
	- Fixed 'magic numbers' in camera trap handling
	- Implemented sensible form-change system with sensible input handling

# 21.07.07 #
	- Changed rendering system from rendering in a native 640x360 resolution to rendering in full
	window/fullscreen resolution, properly scaling all textures from native in textureToCamera()
	and textureToGui() (aka made game render 'fake pixel art')

# 21.07.08 #
	- Fixed a bug that made sprite position stick the '640x360 grid' producing vibrating effect during movement
	- Dealt with a longstanding issue of integer 'Rectangle' that was used as a cookie-cutter representation for
	all rectangles, despite the fact that when dealing with physics and texture-scaling they should be float,
	and when dealing with textures regular SDL_Rect should be used to avoid unnecessary conversions
	- Introduced 'srcRect' and 'dstRect' akin to SDL_Rect to separate rendering logic from physical logic,
	that also lead to a small optimization
	- Changed 'Rectangle' to use double precision instead of integer, went through a ton of code fixing precision
	to the correct one, eliminated a lot of useless rounding
	- Minor optimizations of 'Rectangle' methods
	- Deprecated 'Vector2.length2_rough()' since it's ineffective

	slightly when running into the wall, small teleportation when hitting a corner of a tile midair
	- A lot of new methods in 'dRect' to optimize some things and generally make the class simpler
	to use, a little polish of 'geometry_utils' in general

	- Improved friction mechanic to instantly stop body unaffected by external forces when its
	horizontal speed changes direction due to friction deceleration, this mechanic removes a short
	period when horizontal speed oscillates around 0 before full stop

	- Worked on assets
	- Implemented barebones player-hand-following-cursor

# 21.07.14 #
	- Fixed 'Camera' class to return unscaled FOV correctly

	- Deprecated 'up'/'down' controls
	- Improved entity erasion system to allow erasing after a delay, which simplifies implementing upon-destruction effects
	- Fixed visual bug where projectiles would appear flipped vertically when fired to the left
	- Simplified 'Faction' mechanic, removed unnecessary faction 'NONE'
	- Separated 'makable' enities that can be parsed from map files and 'spawnable'  entities that can be only
	spawned during the game into different file, refactored entity-related namespaces to be less cumbersome
	- Since now there's a bazillion entity-related files, separated them all into a new filter

# 21.07.16 #
	- Fixed a bug where projectile would deal damage multiple time
	- Improved attack condition for sludge, fixed a bug where enemy was unable to attack if player hitbox is too big
	- Standardized names for namespaces with consts
